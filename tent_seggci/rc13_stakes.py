RC13 — CONSEQUENCE-AWARE ROUTING
=================================

The system has no experience. It has never been wrong and paid for it.
This module injects stakes as a structural dimension of routing.

Three additions to v9.1:

  1. StakeVector on wells
     Each well carries: fp_cost, fn_cost, reversibility.
     False positive cost: harm from routing something here that shouldn't be.
     False negative cost: harm from failing to route something here that should be.
     Reversibility: 0.0 = permanent consequence, 1.0 = fully recoverable.

  2. Stakes-scaled confirmation threshold
     High-stakes wells require stronger signal before accepting a route.
     Threshold: bands_required = BASE_BANDS + floor(risk_weight * MAX_EXTRA)
     Risk weight = (fp_cost + fn_cost) * (1 - reversibility)

  3. Consequence-aware abstain (NO_ROUTE)
     If best candidate well has confidence < stakes-adjusted threshold:
     return NO_ROUTE rather than best guess.
     A wrong confident answer to a high-stakes query is worse than no answer.

This is not a filter on output. It is a filter on confidence before output.
The distinction matters: the system isn't becoming more conservative.
It is becoming calibrated to the cost of being wrong.
