RC14 — ESCALATION TIERS
========================

RC13 established stakes as a routing dimension.
RC14 establishes that high-stakes domains are not flat.
They are tiered. The tier is determined by symptom co-occurrence.

The key insight:
    A single token does not determine urgency.
    A conjunction of tokens does.

    "chest" alone    → no route
    "tightness"      → no route
    "chest tightness"→ Level 2: warning, seek help
    "pain + tingling"→ Level 1: immediate, call emergency services

This is the difference between OR matching (how TENT has worked until now)
and AND matching (conjunction gate).

OR:  any keyword in the set contributes to score
AND: all keywords in a required set must be present to activate tier

Architecture:

    EscalationTier
        level:       int         — 1 = immediate, 2 = urgent, 3 = monitor
        label:       str         — human-readable urgency
        action:      str         — required response
        conjuncts:   list[set]   — list of AND-groups; any group match fires tier
        stakes:      StakeVector — consequence weight for this tier

    DomainStack
        domain:      str
        tiers:       list[EscalationTier] — ordered highest urgency first

Router evaluates tiers in order (1 → 2 → 3).
First tier whose conjunction fires → route there.
No conjunction fires → NO_ROUTE.
